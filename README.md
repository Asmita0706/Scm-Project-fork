Problem Overview:-
     In today's fast-paced digital world, travellers face challenges when booking hotels, including limited availability updates, manual reservation processes, lack of transparency in pricing, and difficulty managing bookings. Many hotel management systems are either outdated, inefficient, or lack integration with modern technologies, leading to poor customer experience and revenue loss for hotels.
Proposed Solution:-
The Online Hotel Booking System will provide a user-friendly, real-time, and secure platform for travellers to search, compare, and book hotels seamlessly. The system will feature:- 
1)A searchable hotel database with live availability and pricing.
2)A secure booking process with online payments.
3)A user account system for managing reservations.
4)A hotel admin dashboard for room and booking management.
5)Automated notifications for booking confirmations & updates.
